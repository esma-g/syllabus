A module consists of a series of sprints.

Before the module starts, you need to check the requirements.

During the module, you will be working on the sprints.

Each sprint has the same structure as a module: requirements, objectives, a timeline, and a backlog.

At the end of the module, check the acceptance criteria in Success to understand your progess.
