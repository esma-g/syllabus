### Gameplay

{{<note title="Game (30 minutes)" type="activity">}}
In groups or breakout rooms of 4 trainees maximum.

One person will share their screen and be the **driver**. The driver can only move the pieces where you are told by the navigators. The driver cannot make any decisions!

The others will be the **navigators**. Together, the navigators must figure out a strategy to unblock the car, and tell the driver how to do it!

**Each person must drive,** so set a timer for [**5 minutes per round**](https://www.google.com/search?q=set+a+timer+for+5+minutes) and then swap.

{{<note title="Tip" type="tip">}}
Mentors can only be passengers: no driving or navigating. Mentors may ask questions but not answer them. Mentors will make sure the driver and navigators are following their roles correctly.
