Learning objectives are stored on the block level, so they are not repeated on each page. This page is used to display the objectives in a checkbox list.

You can override the default objectives on a block by adding an objective-override to the block when you call it on your day page. You might want to reuse an activity but with a different focus. For example, you might want to use the [Blockers!](/module/blocks/blockers/) activity but with a focus on communication.
