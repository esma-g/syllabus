## Group size

A group has a maximum size of 30 people. If you have more than 30 trainees, you need to split into more groups. For example: if you have 36 trainees, split into two group of 18.

## Setting up

Trainees must complete the preparation materials and come to class prepared. People will probably have some questions and hit some blockers. Use the CYF Slack channels to answer questions and help people get unstuck. People who consistently fail to prepare will probably fail the course, so don't heroically rescue them every week, as it only drags the disaster out longer.

## Schedule

The Coordinator owns the schedule of the module and leads a 30 minute mid week planning call before each session.

1. Each mentor notes page has an example schedule for the week, which you can adapt to suit your cohort.
2. You should also schedule at least one short break in the afternoon for prayers, breastfeeding, and other obligations.
3. Parcel out the sessions between volunteers in the planning call. At CYF we teach in teams and no one person dominates the day.
4. Once you've planned, make sure you share the schedule with all trainees and volunteers _at least 24 hours beforehand_, so they can make any necessary travel, childcare, religious, and other logistical arrangements.

## Example agenda

The example agenda shows how sections could be composed on a Saturday. The independent study section is the only section that must be protected: it’s vital that trainees get at least 2.5 hours to work independently.

| Time          | Section           | Leader         |

Coordinator action: trainees always get at least 2.5 hours to work on coursework and projects in class with TAs to support them. The coordinator should make sure that the independent study section is protected.

## Coursework

Trainees work through around 20 hours of coursework each week. Coursework is stored on the Module repo in GitHub issues. Trainees copy the coursework to their own Coursework Planners and manage their work on their Coursework Planning Boards.

Mentors should check in with trainees on their Coursework Planning Boards in class.

## Code review

We do lots of code review at CYF. Our grads consistently cite code review as having the most impact on their development. We do code review on GitHub. Go to teachertraining.codeyourfuture.io to find out more about how we do code review.

## Module project

Trainees do lots of projects on the course, but they must produce one substantial product every module for their portfolio. 24-30 hours of coursework time is allotted to this project development per module.

The module coordinator should find someone to lead the module project. Mentors are encouraged to innovate and experiment with the project requirement, within the time constraints of the module.
