      <description>Background Our syllabus is used by all of our schools to give them direction on what we teach, provide outlines for our lessons and be a central hub of CodeYourFuture&amp;rsquo;s education knowledge.
Historically, all of the content was created and maintained by the Lead Teachers of each module. This has some benefits in that teachers get to teach their content immediately for instant feedback - however we&amp;rsquo;ve often found that incremental improvements have been harder to achieve as volunteers are moved onto the next module.</description>
